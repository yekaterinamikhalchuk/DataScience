|Car prices predictions |Dataset with well data, its volume of reserves and several features|<ul><li>Prepare data for analysis;</li><li>Look at the features distribution</li><li>Create models for car prices predictions</li><li>Calculate RMSE and MAPE metrics</li><li>Calculate model training and prediction time for each model</li><li>Test the best model and prepare a summary</li></ul>|The optimal prediction model is the random forest model with default parameters. This models shows the best results and also not so slow as LGBM model. We managed to get rmse=1638 euro and mape=33.08% on the test sample <ul>|<ul><li>Pandas</li><li>Numpy</li><li>Matplotlib.pyplot</li><li>LightGBM</li><li>sklearn</li></ul>|
