| Predicting the probability of bank customers' churn | Dataset with customers' data and their actions from the source: https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling | 1. Prepare data for analysis; 2. Look at the features distribution 3. Look at the models' results with the default parameters   4. Use several ways to balance the classes: balancing them in hyper-parameters, upsampling and downsampling 5. Test the best model and prepare a summary | Conclusion  | Conclusion  |
