Although the revenue of 200 rechist wells in the second region is the lowest by comparison with the first and the third ones, it is explained by data crowding (rmse amounts only 0.89 thousands of monetary units)  <ul>|<ul><li>Pandas</li><li>Numpy</li><li>Matplotlib.pyplot</li><li>Bootstrap</li><li>sklearn</li></ul>|
